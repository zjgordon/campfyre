title: Initialize Vite React project with TypeScript
sprint: FRAMEWORK_FOUNDATIONS
status: todo
owner: cursor
links:
  - docs/plans/FRAMEWORK_FOUNDATIONS.md
acceptance:
  - Vite 5.0+ project initialized in /web directory
  - React 18.2+ installed and configured
  - TypeScript 5.2+ configured with strict settings matching root config
  - Build output configured for containerization with proper asset handling
  - All dependencies installed and working
  - Code compiles, lints, tests pass
  - Update CURRENT_SPRINT.md with log entry
  - Update PROJECT_STATUS.md with one-liner
  - Commit follows Conventional Commits with [CARD-021]
artifacts:
  - /web/package.json with correct dependencies
  - /web/vite.config.ts with proper configuration
  - /web/tsconfig.json with strict TypeScript settings
  - /web/src/main.tsx with basic React app
  - /web/index.html with proper meta tags
rollbackPlan:
  - Remove /web directory if initialization fails
  - Revert package.json changes if dependency issues occur
notes: |
  CRITICAL: Current /web directory contains Express server dependencies, not React/Vite.
  This card must completely replace the existing /web setup with proper React/Vite foundation.
  Remove existing Express dependencies and initialize fresh Vite + React + TypeScript project.
  Ensure TypeScript configuration matches the root project settings for consistency.
  Configure Vite for proper asset handling in containerized environment.
  Use pnpm for package management (project uses pnpm@8.10.0, not npm).
