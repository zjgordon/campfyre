sprint: FRAMEWORK_FOUNDATIONS
status: todo
owner: cursor
links:
  - docs/plans/FRAMEWORK_FOUNDATIONS.md
acceptance:
  - Performance testing and benchmarking implemented
  - Container startup time measured and optimized
  - API response times benchmarked
  - Memory usage across services monitored
  - Concurrent connections tested and validated
  - Code compiles, lints, tests pass
  - Update CURRENT_SPRINT.md with log entry
  - Update PROJECT_STATUS.md with one-liner
  - Commit follows Conventional Commits with [CARD-098]
artifacts:
  - /tests/performance/startup.test.ts
  - /tests/performance/apiResponse.test.ts
  - /tests/performance/memoryUsage.test.ts
  - /tests/performance/concurrentConnections.test.ts
  - /tests/performance/helpers/benchmarkHelper.ts
rollbackPlan:
  - Remove performance testing if implementation fails
  - Check for performance testing configuration issues
  - Verify performance benchmarks work correctly
notes: |
  Implement comprehensive performance testing and benchmarking.
  Measure container startup time and optimize for faster deployment.
  Benchmark API response times and memory usage across services.
  Test concurrent connections and system scalability.
