title: Implement database connection pooling and optimization
sprint: FRAMEWORK_FOUNDATIONS
status: todo
owner: cursor
links:
  - docs/plans/FRAMEWORK_FOUNDATIONS.md
acceptance:
  - Database connection pooling configured
  - Connection limits and timeouts set
  - Query optimization implemented
  - Database performance monitoring
  - Connection health monitoring
  - Code compiles, lints, tests pass
  - Update CURRENT_SPRINT.md with log entry
  - Update PROJECT_STATUS.md with one-liner
  - Commit follows Conventional Commits with [CARD-048]
artifacts:
  - /api/src/config/database.ts with pooling config
  - /api/src/lib/connectionPool.ts
  - /api/src/lib/queryOptimizer.ts
  - /api/src/middleware/dbPerformance.ts
  - /api/.env.example with pool configuration
rollbackPlan:
  - Revert to basic connection if pooling fails
  - Check for connection limit issues
  - Verify performance optimizations work
notes: |
  Implement database connection pooling for optimal performance.
  Configure connection limits and timeouts for production.
  Add query optimization and performance monitoring.
  Ensure connection health monitoring works correctly.
