  - /web/src/App.tsx with ThemeProvider
  - /web/src/components/MUIComponents.tsx with basic components

rollbackPlan:
  - Remove MUI dependencies if installation fails
  - Revert to basic HTML/CSS styling
  - Check for MUI v5 vs v7 compatibility issues
notes: |
  CRITICAL: Use MUI v7.0+ with Emotion 11.11+, NOT MUI v5.
  This prevents the common MUI v5/v7 compatibility issues.
  Configure Material Design 3 theme system with proper tokens.
  Ensure all MUI components are properly typed with TypeScript.
  Use pnpm for package management (project uses pnpm@8.10.0, not npm).
