acceptance:
  - Centralized error logging implemented
  - Pino logger configured for structured logging
  - Error correlation IDs for request tracking
  - Log levels and filtering configured
  - Error aggregation and reporting
  - Code compiles, lints, tests pass
  - Update CURRENT_SPRINT.md with log entry
  - Update PROJECT_STATUS.md with one-liner

rollbackPlan:
  - Remove centralized logging if implementation fails
  - Check for logging configuration issues
  - Verify error correlation works correctly
notes: |
  Implement centralized error logging with Pino for structured logging.
  Set up error correlation IDs for request tracking.
  Configure log levels and filtering for different environments.
  Implement error aggregation and reporting capabilities.
