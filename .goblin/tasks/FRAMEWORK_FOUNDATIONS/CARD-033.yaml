status: todo
owner: cursor
links:
  - docs/plans/FRAMEWORK_FOUNDATIONS.md
acceptance:
  - Shared types package created with proper exports
  - Common types defined for API, user, game entities
  - Type exports configured for backend usage
  - Zod schemas integrated with TypeScript types
  - Type safety ensured across backend
  - Code compiles, lints, tests pass
  - Update CURRENT_SPRINT.md with log entry
  - Update PROJECT_STATUS.md with one-liner
  - Commit follows Conventional Commits with [CARD-033]
artifacts:
  - /api/src/types/shared.ts
  - /api/src/types/api.ts
  - /api/src/types/user.ts
  - /api/src/types/game.ts
  - /api/src/lib/validation.ts with Zod schemas

rollbackPlan:
  - Remove shared types if configuration fails
  - Revert to individual type definitions
  - Check for TypeScript compilation issues
notes: |
  Create shared types package for consistent typing across backend.
  Define common types for API responses, user data, and game entities.
  Integrate Zod schemas with TypeScript types for runtime validation.
  Prepare for future frontend integration with tRPC client.
