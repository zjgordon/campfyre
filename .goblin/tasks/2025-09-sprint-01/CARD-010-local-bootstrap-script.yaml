acceptance:
  - A bootstrap script exists (`scripts/bootstrap.sh` or Makefile target) that:
      - Runs docker compose up for core services
      - Waits until healthchecks pass (API + DB at minimum)
      - Runs package install + db migrate + seed (trivial data)
      - Prints a friendly "Campfyre ready → http://localhost:3000" message
  - Demo seed creates a "Hello World Campaign" with one sample session
  - Script documented in README.md ("Quickstart Dev Environment")
  - CONTRIBUTING.md updated with how to use bootstrap script
  - Update /docs/CURRENT_SPRINT.md with a 5–8 line summary
  - Update /docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md with a single-line entry under this sprint
  - Update /meta/TASK_STATE.yaml breadcrumb/active status
  - Single Conventional Commit created including [CARD-010]
artifacts:
  created:
    - scripts/bootstrap.sh
    - prisma/seed.ts (or trivial SQL seed file)
  modified:
    - docker-compose.yml (if tweaks needed)
    - README.md
    - CONTRIBUTING.md
    - docs/CURRENT_SPRINT.md
    - docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md
    - meta/TASK_STATE.yaml
notes: |
  Scope:
    - Keep bootstrap minimal but repeatable.
    - Example flow:
        1. docker compose up -d
        2. Wait until curl http://localhost:3000/health returns ok
        3. pnpm install (or yarn/npm) in root
        4. pnpm prisma migrate dev
        5. pnpm prisma db seed
        6. echo "Campfyre ready → http://localhost:3000"
    - Demo seed can be ultra-simple:
        - Campaign: "Hello World Campaign"
        - Session: "First Session"
        - Template: D&D 5e stub
    - Document both *first-time dev setup* and *resetting environment*.
    - DoD:
        - New contributor can run ./scripts/bootstrap.sh and land in a working local environment.
        - Docs explain when to run, how to reset, and what to expect.
