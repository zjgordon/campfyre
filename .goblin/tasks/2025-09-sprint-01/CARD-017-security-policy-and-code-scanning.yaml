  Scope:
    - SECURITY.md contents:
        # Security Policy
        ## Reporting a Vulnerability
        Please report vulnerabilities privately via email (replace with maintainer email, zjgordon.dev@gmail.com ).
        Do not open public issues for security problems.
        We aim to respond within 7 days.
        ## Supported Versions
        Only the latest release is actively supported for security fixes.
    - CodeQL workflow:
        - Uses GitHub’s starter CodeQL workflow for js/ts.
        - Runs on push, PR, and weekly schedule.
        - Alerts appear in Security > Code scanning.
    - DECISIONS.md entry example:
        2025-09-11 — Baseline security: policy + CodeQL scanning
        Context: need proactive posture before first public contributions.
        Decision: add SECURITY.md and CodeQL scanning workflow.
        Consequences: contributors know how to report issues; repo scanned continuously.
    - DoD:
        - SECURITY.md visible in repo root.
        - CodeQL workflow runs and passes on CI.
        - Alerts tab functional in GitHub Security.
        - Docs updated for contributor awareness.
