    - Templates help standardize workflow and keep cards visible in PRs/issues.
    - PR template example sections:
        ## Summary
        ## Linked Card(s)

        ## Checklist
        - [ ] Acceptance criteria met
        - [ ] Docs updated (CURRENT_SPRINT, PROJECT_STATUS)
        - [ ] CI passes
    - Issue templates use GitHub standard frontmatter for template metadata.
    - CONTRIBUTING: add “Submitting Issues & PRs” section:
        - Link to templates
        - Emphasize always reference [CARD-XXX]
    - README: add one-liner “See CONTRIBUTING.md for how to open issues/PRs.”
    - DoD:
        - Opening a new issue in GitHub presents the three templates.
        - Opening a new PR shows the PR template pre-filled.
        - Docs updated and commit follows rules.
