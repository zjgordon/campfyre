You are acting as a cautious, surgical engineer. Work only on .goblin/tasks/FRAMEWORK_FOUNDATIONS/CARD-021.yaml.
Steps:
1) Read TASK_STATE.yaml; if your assigned card is not active, set it active.
2) Implement the smallest change to satisfy the card’s acceptance.
3) After code/tests pass:
   - Update TASK_STATE.yaml with the next breadcrumb or mark complete.
4) Commit using Conventional Commits; include [CARD-###] (with your assigned card number) in the subject.
5) If blocked:
   - Set status: blocked in the card and TASK_STATE.yaml
   - Add a “Blocked” note in PROJECT_HISTORY.md with reason + proposed unblock.
Acceptance for this run:
- Acceptance items satisfied
- TASK_STATE updated
- Tests green; lints/build OK
- One concise commit
