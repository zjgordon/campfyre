# Security & Secrets

- Never commit secrets. Use `.env` & rotate credentials as needed.
- Validate inputs against injection/XSS vectors. Encode output correctly on the web.
- Use secure cookies/tokens; minimize PII surface. Log only what's necessary, with redaction.
- Before release tagging, run dependency checks and skim `SECURITY.md` for policy conformance.
