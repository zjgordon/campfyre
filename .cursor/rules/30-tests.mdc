# Test Conventions

- Prefer **Jest** (per repo config). Keep tests deterministic and fast.
- **Web** tests: use testing-library and `jsdom` env; avoid asserting implementation details.
- **API** tests: supertest (or equivalent) for HTTP; seed minimal data per test file.
- CI should run the full test suite. Add `npm test` scripts under package.json where missing.

# Coverage & placement
- Co-locate tests near code or under top-level `__tests__`. Name files `*.test.ts`.
