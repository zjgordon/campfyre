# Database Schema Documentation

This document describes the comprehensive database schema for the Campfyre TTRPG platform, designed to support tabletop role-playing games with real-time features, character management, and campaign organization.

The database schema is built using Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL and is designed to be:

- **Scalable**: Supports multiple game systems and large campaigns
- **Flexible**: JSON-based character sheets adapt to different TTRPG systems
- **Real-time Ready**: Schema supports WebRTC and live communication features
- **Type-safe**: Full TypeScript integration with Prisma-generated types

### Game System Template Structure

The `characterSheetTemplate` field in the GameSystem model defines the structure for character sheets:

```json
{
  "attributes": [
    {
      "name": "string",
      "abbreviation": "string",
      "description": "string"
    }
  ],
  "skills": [
    {
      "name": "string",
      "attribute": "string",
      "description": "string"
    }
  ],
  "classes": [
    {
      "name": "string",

```

### Message Metadata Structure

The `metadata` field in the Message model supports rich message features:

```json
{
  "mentions": ["user_id"],
  "reactions": {
    "üëç": ["user_id"],
    "üé≤": ["user_id"]
  },
  "diceRolls": [
    {

      "rolls": [4, 5]
    }
  ],
  "characterAction": {
    "characterId": "character_id",
    "action": "Attack",
    "target": "Goblin"
  },
  "systemMessage": {
    "type": "join",

}
```

## Real-time Features Support

The schema is designed to support real-time features:

### WebRTC Integration

- User sessions track device information for WebRTC connections
- Game session settings include voice/video chat preferences
- Message metadata supports real-time communication features

### Live Updates

- Messages support real-time chat with mentions and reactions
- Character sheets can be updated in real-time during sessions
- Game session status changes are tracked for live updates

### Notifications

- Real-time notifications for campaign events
- Message mentions trigger immediate notifications
- Session reminders and updates

## Indexing Strategy

### Primary Indexes

- All `id` fields (primary keys)
- Unique constraints on `email`, `username`, `token`
- Composite indexes on foreign key relationships

### Performance Indexes

- `campaignId` on characters and game sessions
- `userId` on all user-related entities
- `gameSessionId` on messages
- `createdAt` for time-based queries

### Search Indexes

- Full-text search on campaign names and descriptions
- Character name and description search
- Message content search (with privacy considerations)

## Data Validation

### Prisma Schema Validation

- All required fields are marked as non-nullable
- String length limits enforced at database level
- Enum values restricted to predefined options
- Foreign key constraints ensure referential integrity

### Application-Level Validation

- Zod schemas for all input validation
- Character sheet JSON structure validation
- Message content sanitization
- File upload validation for images

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection

- Sensitive data (passwords, tokens) handled separately
- User preferences and settings properly typed
- Message content limited to prevent abuse
- Image URLs validated for security

### Access Control

- Campaign visibility controls data access
- Role-based permissions through campaign membership
- Session-based authentication with expiration
- IP address tracking for security monitoring

## Migration Strategy

### Schema Evolution

- Backward-compatible changes preferred
- JSON fields allow flexible schema evolution
- Version tracking for game systems
- Gradual migration for breaking changes

### Data Migration

- Prisma migrations for structural changes
- Custom scripts for data transformation
- Backup strategies for critical data
- Rollback procedures for failed migrations

## Performance Optimization

### Query Optimization

- Eager loading for related data
- Pagination for large result sets
- Efficient filtering and sorting
- Connection pooling for database access

### Caching Strategy

- Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- Character sheet caching during sessions
- Campaign metadata caching
- User session caching

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Database Metrics

- Query performance monitoring
- Connection pool utilization
- Index usage statistics
- Error rate tracking

### Business Metrics

- User engagement tracking
- Campaign activity metrics
- Session duration analytics
- Popular game systems tracking

## Future Considerations

### Scalability

- Horizontal scaling with read replicas
- Sharding strategies for large datasets
- Microservice architecture support
- Event-driven architecture integration

### Feature Extensions

- Plugin system for custom game mechanics
- Advanced character sheet customization
- Campaign template system
- Integration with external TTRPG tools

This schema provides a solid foundation for a comprehensive TTRPG platform while maintaining flexibility for future enhancements and system-specific customizations.
