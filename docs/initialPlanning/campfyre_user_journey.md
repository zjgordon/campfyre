# 🌟 Campfyre – First-Time User Journey  

## 1. Hosting a Game (Admin/GM)  

### Step 1: Spin It Up  
- You run one command:  
  ```bash
  docker compose up -d
  ```  
- In under a minute, Campfyre is running on your machine or server.  
- A clean welcome page confirms it’s live and shows you the session dashboard.  

### Step 2: Create a Campaign  
- Click **“New Campaign”**, give it a name (“Dragonheart Saga”), choose a system template (D&D 5e, Fate, or Homebrew).  
- Add a short description and a campaign banner image.  
- Done — you now have a campaign hub.  

### Step 3: Schedule a Session  
- From the campaign hub, click **“New Session.”**  
- Add the title (“Session 1: Into the Woods”), date/time, and optional agenda notes.  
- Invite players by sending a shareable link (one-click copy).  

### Step 4: Prep Your Table  
- Upload a scene map or handout.  
- Add NPCs or notes to your GM panel.  
- Test video and audio with the built-in device setup.

## 2. Joining a Game (Players)  

### Step 1: Follow the Link  
- A player clicks the invite link on their phone, tablet, or laptop.  
- No installation, no account hassle — they’re dropped right into the session lobby.  

### Step 2: Set Your Character  
- Pick an avatar and name, or import a sheet from the campaign template.  
- HP, stats, and abilities appear in a clean, editable card.  

### Step 3: Choose Your View  
- The player can switch between **Map View, Video Grid, Character Sheets**, or a split layout.  
- Each player can theme their own UI (dark, forest, neon, etc.).  

### Step 4: Start Playing  
- Dice rolls pop on screen with animations.  
- HP updates instantly for everyone when a player takes damage.  
- GM reveals parts of the map with a quick drag.  
- Handouts appear with a subtle animation, ready to pin or download.

## 3. Streaming or Hybrid Play  

- The GM activates **Overlay Mode** → OBS/Twitch picks up a polished view showing dice rolls, initiative order, and the current scene title.  
- For hybrid groups, one video feed shows the in-person table, the others join remotely. Everyone sees the same game state.  

---

## 4. Wrapping Up a Session  

- The GM clicks **“End Session”** — a recap page appears.  
- Session log is auto-summarized (dice rolls, initiative order, key notes).  
- GM can edit the recap, then publish it to the campaign hub.  
- Players can leave reactions or notes (“favorite moment: the goblin banter!”).  

---

## 5. The Ongoing Campaign  

- Returning players simply rejoin through the same campaign link.  
- All characters, maps, and logs are preserved.  
- Templates can evolve over time — add new mechanics, switch systems, or customize sheets without losing history.
