# 🔥 Campfyre – Gather, Play, Tell Your Story  

## Why Campfyre?  
Tabletop RPGs are about people, stories, and imagination. But online play often feels clunky — juggling video calls, dice bots, spreadsheets, and apps that look like they’re stuck in the 90s.  

**Campfyre** is a modern hub for roleplaying games. Lightweight, modular, and community-driven, it’s designed to make digital play feel as natural as gathering around a real campfire.
