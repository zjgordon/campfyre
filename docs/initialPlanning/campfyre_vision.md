# 🌟 Campfyre Vision Document

## Overview
**Campfyre** is a new category of digital TTRPG platform: **a modular, lightweight hub for remote and hybrid play.**  

Where existing tools feel bloated, outdated, or tied to a single ruleset, Campfyre is built to be:  
- **Lightweight** — easy to host, easy to use.  
- **Modular** — only use the pieces you want.  
- **System-agnostic** — works for D&D, Pathfinder, indie zines, and homebrew.  
- **Modern & inviting** — sleek design, themable, mobile-friendly.  

The goal: *make running and playing tabletop RPGs online feel as natural and fun as gathering around a real campfire.*

## Core Principles

- **System Flexibility** – Templates for popular systems, and simple ways to add custom mechanics.  
- **Player Experience First** – A modern UI that adapts to each player’s device and taste.  
- **Community-Driven** – Encourage template sharing, custom themes, and open contributions.  
- **Streaming-Friendly** – Out-of-the-box overlays and audience-ready views for streamers and creators.
