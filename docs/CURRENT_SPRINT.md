### CARD-001: Setup spike – baseline repo skeleton & guardrails

**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Owner:** cursor  
**Epic:** Epic 1 – Foundations & MVP

Successfully established the foundational repository structure with comprehensive development tooling. Implemented monorepo setup with pnpm workspaces, configured linting/formatting with ESLint and Prettier, set up TypeScript compilation, and established testing framework with Jest. Created Docker Compose configuration with all required services (API, web, database, Redis, TURN server, reverse proxy) and health endpoints. Configured pre-commit hooks for code quality enforcement and Conventional Commits for standardized commit messages. Added comprehensive error response contract documentation. All services are containerized and ready for local development with `docker compose up`.

### CARD-002: Configure pre-commit + lint-staged hooks (lint/format/typecheck/tests)

**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Owner:** cursor  
**Epic:** Epic 1 – Foundations & MVP

Enhanced the pre-commit hook system to provide comprehensive code quality enforcement. Configured lint-staged to run ESLint and Prettier on staged files only, ensuring fast feedback loops. Added TypeScript type checking (tsc --noEmit) and unit test execution to the pre-commit pipeline. Implemented a guard mechanism that prevents commits when an active card is set in TASK_STATE.yaml but docs/CURRENT_SPRINT.md is not staged, enforcing documentation discipline. The hook system is now idempotent and provides clear error messages for failed checks. All acceptance criteria satisfied with comprehensive linting, formatting, type checking, and testing on every commit.
