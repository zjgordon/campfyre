### CARD-001: Setup spike – baseline repo skeleton & guardrails
**Status:** ✅ Completed

Created Docker Compose configuration with all required services (API, web, database, Redis, TURN server, reverse proxy) and health endpoints. Configured pre-commit hooks for code quality enforcement and Conventional Commits for standardized commit messages. Added comprehensive error response contract documentation. All services are containerized and ready for local development with `docker compose up`.
