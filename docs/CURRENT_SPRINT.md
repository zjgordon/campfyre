## Progress Log

<!-- Cursor appends new sections here per task card -->

### CARD-001: Setup spike – baseline repo skeleton & guardrails

**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Owner:** cursor  
**Epic:** Epic 1 – Foundations & MVP

Successfully established the foundational repository structure with comprehensive development tooling. Implemented monorepo setup with pnpm workspaces, configured linting/formatting with ESLint and Prettier, set up TypeScript compilation, and established testing framework with Jest. Created Docker Compose configuration with all required services (API, web, database, Redis, TURN server, reverse proxy) and health endpoints. Configured pre-commit hooks for code quality enforcement and Conventional Commits for standardized commit messages. Added comprehensive error response contract documentation. All services are containerized and ready for local development with `docker compose up`.

### CARD-002: Configure pre-commit + lint-staged hooks (lint/format/typecheck/tests)

**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Owner:** cursor  
**Epic:** Epic 1 – Foundations & MVP

Enhanced the pre-commit hook system to provide comprehensive code quality enforcement. Configured lint-staged to run ESLint and Prettier on staged files only, ensuring fast feedback loops. Added TypeScript type checking (tsc --noEmit) and unit test execution to the pre-commit pipeline. Implemented a guard mechanism that prevents commits when an active card is set in TASK_STATE.yaml but docs/CURRENT_SPRINT.md is not staged, enforcing documentation discipline. The hook system is now idempotent and provides clear error messages for failed checks. All acceptance criteria satisfied with comprehensive linting, formatting, type checking, and testing on every commit.

### CARD-003: CI pipeline skeleton (GitHub Actions: lint, typecheck, test, build)

**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Owner:** cursor  
**Epic:** Epic 1 – Foundations & MVP

Established a comprehensive GitHub Actions CI pipeline that mirrors local development workflows. Created a four-stage pipeline with sequential jobs: lint, typecheck, test, and build, ensuring code quality gates at each stage. Configured Node.js 20 with pnpm package manager caching for optimal performance. Added monorepo support with recursive build commands across all workspace packages. Implemented test artifact upload on failure for debugging purposes. Added CI status badge to README.md for immediate visibility of build health. The pipeline runs on all pushes and pull requests, providing fast feedback for development workflows. All acceptance criteria satisfied with a robust, scalable CI foundation.

### CARD-004: Conventional Commits + commitlint setup

**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Owner:** cursor  
**Epic:** Epic 1 – Foundations & MVP

Added README.md section referencing Conventional Commits with link to contributing guidelines. The commit-msg hook automatically validates all commit messages, rejecting non-conforming commits with helpful error messages. This enables automated changelog generation and maintains parseable commit history for better project management. All acceptance criteria satisfied with robust commit message enforcement.

### CARD-005: Repo docs sync (baseline discoverability & cross-links)

**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Owner:** cursor  
**Epic:** Epic 1 – Foundations & MVP

Synchronized repository documentation for comprehensive discoverability and cross-linking. Enhanced README.md with project elevator pitch, quickstart instructions, repository layout, and links to all core documentation.

Created UX_GUIDE.md to complement existing UX_PLAN.md with design language and accessibility guidelines. Verified all core docs exist with consistent titles and descriptions. Added AGPL-3.0 license badge and CI status badge to README.md. All documentation now provides clear navigation paths and comprehensive development guidance for contributors. All acceptance criteria satisfied with robust documentation foundation.

### CARD-006: Cursor update loop smoke test (trivial feature + doc sync)

**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Owner:** cursor  
**Epic:** Epic 1 – Foundations & MVP

Successfully validated the complete Cursor update loop workflow through implementation of a trivial /ping endpoint. Added GET /ping endpoint to API returning { ok: true, msg: "pong" } as specified. Tested endpoint functionality and confirmed proper JSON response. Executed full development cycle: implement → test → commit with proper documentation updates. Verified pre-commit hooks run correctly (lint, typecheck, tests, CURRENT_SPRINT check). All acceptance criteria satisfied demonstrating the workflow is functional and repeatable for future card execution. This smoke test establishes confidence in the development process and validates all tooling integration.

### CARD-007: Dev container + editor config (optional polish)

**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Owner:** cursor  
**Epic:** Epic 1 – Foundations & MVP

Enhanced development experience with comprehensive dev container and editor configuration. Created .devcontainer/devcontainer.json with Node.js 20 runtime, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Coturn services matching docker-compose setup. Pre-installed essential extensions including ESLint, Prettier, Prisma, Docker, and GitLens for immediate productivity. Established .editorconfig with standard settings for consistent formatting across all editors (2 spaces, LF, UTF-8, trim whitespace). Updated README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md with clear instructions for dev container usage and editorconfig benefits. All acceptance criteria satisfied providing optional but valuable developer experience improvements for VS Code and Cursor users.

### CARD-008: ADR starter entries (seed DECISIONS.md and workflow)

**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Owner:** cursor  
**Epic:** Epic 1 – Foundations & MVP

Seeded Architecture Decision Records with three foundational ADRs documenting key architectural choices.
