# ðŸ§­ Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Use this log to capture *why* we made non-trivial choices. Keep entries concise (10â€“20 lines).
Each entry gets a date and a short title. Newest entries go on top.

> Tips
> - Prefer one decision per entry.
> - Link related PRs, issues, and code where helpful.
> - If a decision is reversed, add a new entry and link both ways.

## 2025-09-08 â€” (Example) Video mesh for MVP; SFU adapter later
**Context**  
â‰¤5 participants in MVP, self-host simplicity, speed-to-value. Larger tables are out-of-scope initially.

**Decision**  
Use WebRTC mesh + WS signaling with TURN required. Define an `RTCService` adapter boundary to enable SFU swap (e.g., LiveKit/mediasoup) later.

**Consequences**  
Simple deploy, fast iteration. Wonâ€™t scale past ~5 peers; plan SFU pilot behind a feature flag in Epic 3.
