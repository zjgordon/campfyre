  Style & consistency:
    - Ensure each core doc starts with a one-line purpose sentence.

    - Keep README succinct; push depth into /docs.
  DoD:
    - README + CONTRIBUTING render cleanly on GitHub with working relative links.
    - All core docs discoverable from README.
    - CI badge visible (placeholder acceptable until repo public).
