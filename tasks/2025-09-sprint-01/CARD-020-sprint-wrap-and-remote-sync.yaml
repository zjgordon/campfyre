acceptance:

      - One bullet per completed card
      - Include dates + short status (done/blocked)
      - Leave placeholders for future sprints
  - Ensure all /tasks/2025-09-sprint-01/*.yaml cards committed to repo
  - Ensure docs (ROADMAP, EPIC1_OVERVIEW, TECH_CHOICES, UX_GUIDE, DECISIONS, SPRINT_WORKFLOW) committed and cross-linked from README
  - Push branch `main` to GitHub remote (if not already connected, set origin)
  - Create lightweight tag `v0.0.1-foundation` on sprint close commit and push to remote
  - Add entry in CHANGELOG.md for `0.0.1-foundation` release (cards 001–020)
  - Update README.md with “Foundation Milestone” section linking to the tag/release
  - Update /docs/CURRENT_SPRINT.md with closing summary paragraph
  - Update /docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md with “Sprint Closed” note
  - Update /meta/TASK_STATE.yaml to clear active_card and reset queue

  Scope:
    - This card closes out Sprint 01 (Foundations).
    - Run synth step: CURRENT_SPRINT.md → PROJECT_STATUS.md.
    - Verify all task cards 001–020 exist and are tracked in git.
    - Push to remote: 
        git push origin main
        git push origin v0.0.1-foundation
    - Update CHANGELOG.md:
        ## [0.0.1-foundation] - 2025-09-12

        ### Outcome
        Foundation environment complete; ready for Epic 1 Phase 2.
